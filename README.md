# Natural Language Processing
Language models are designed to generate and analyze text by learning patterns and relationships between tokens (e.g., words, characters).
These models have various applications including text generation, machine translation, sentiment analysis, question answering and summarization.

This repository contains a collection of NLP projects and implementations. It serves as a personal lab for experimenting with and understanding core concepts in natural language processing, including tasks like text classification and generative modeling.

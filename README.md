# TextClassification
Text Classification is the process of categorizing text into different classes and is one of the fundamental problems in natural language processing (NLP). Text classification applications include sentiment analysis, spam detection, categorization, etc.

Implementing text classification requires several steps:
1) Preprocessing text data: Text dataset needs to be preprocessed first (e.g., tokenizing text, removing stop words, ...)
2) Feature extraction - word vectors: The next step is to convert the preprocessed text into numerical features that can be used to develop/train the text classifier model.
3) Classifier model selection and training: Choosing an appropriate classifier is crucial for achieving high accuracy. The model should generalize well to avoid underfitting or overfitting.
4) Implementation: The trained model is used in action to classify new text data (e.g., identifying the sentiment of tweets or reviews).

In this project, I'll provide implementations of different text classifiers.
